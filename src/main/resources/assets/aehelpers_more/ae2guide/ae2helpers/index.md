**ae2helpers** is a Quality of Life addon for Applied Energistics 2 designed to make autocrafting setups smoother and more compact.

# Features

**1. Crafting Result Import Card**
A specialized upgrade for the **Pattern Provider**.
*   **What it does:** Allows a Pattern Provider to **push** ingredients to a machine and **pull** the finished results back using the same face.
*   **Benefit:** Eliminates the need for separate Import Buses and extra channels for simple processing machines.
*   Only useful / needed on machines that don't automatically push their results to neighboring machines.

**2. Automatic Recipe Insertion**
An improved **Crafting Terminal** workflow.
*   **What it does:** When you request an autocraft for a recipe in the terminal, the grid enters a "waiting" state with Ghost Items.
*   **Benefit:** The moment your CPUs finish the job, the items are **automatically inserted** into the grid. No more waiting around to click the recipe again!
